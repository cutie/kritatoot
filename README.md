# KritaToot

A plugin for Krita 4.x that lets you post a copy of your **current** document directly on Mastodon.

Adds **Tools > Post on Mastodon** menu option when enabled. 

A copy of the current document is always exported and posted. 

> If the current document has never been saved, the exported image defaults to a PNG.

You can also specify a message (optional), the privacy setting of your toot (Public, Unlisted, Followers-Only, Direct) and whether you want to hide your image behind a warning title card.

> If no message is given, the default is to include the following: posted with KritaToot

> Log files are written to ~/.kritatoot on Linux.

# Limitation

* Only one image per toot
* Specifying a focal point, found on new Mastodon servers, is not implemented
* Maximum file size and file types are set by the Mastodon server
* no alternate text

# TODO

* implement focal point support or similar feature
* when adding support for multiple images per toot, how do we indicate images and their order
* alternate text
* spoiler text?
